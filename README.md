# Wardriving Utils

This is a collection of utilities to help with wardriving visualizations. It includes:
 - A simple and suboptimal ruby script to convert Marauder's output to KML/GeoJSON.
 - A simple web interface to visualize the data, using Leaflet.js and OpenStreetMap.

## Requirements
The ruby script uses nokogiri, json and optparse gems. You can install them with:

```bash
$ gem install nokogiri json optparse
```

### Running the tests
If you wish to run the tests, you will also need the minitest gem. After installing it, you can run the tests with:

```bash
$ ruby test/test_marauder_to_geodata.rb
```

The web interface is self-contained and should work out of the box.

### Marauder to KML/GeoJSON

```bash
$ ruby marauder_to_geodata.rb --input <input_file> --output <output_file.<kml|json>>
```

Where:
```
- `input_file` is the log file generated by Marauder.
- `output_file` is the file where the GeoJSON or KML data will be saved.
```

The script ignores the log lines that don't have the expected format, such as:

```bash
#wardrive -serial
Starting Wardrive. Stop with stopscan
```

### Web Interface

After generating the GeoJSON file, edit the script.js file to point to the GeoJSON file, in line:
```javascript
fetch("path/to/geojson/file.json")
```

Then, open the index.html file in your browser.
